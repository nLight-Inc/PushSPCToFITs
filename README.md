# PushSPCToFITs
This is a windows service project to push FBN NEQdb SPC data to FITs system

In general, the nLight SPC data will be pushed to FITs, then Fabrinet has its own data process to move FITs data to Fabrinet SPC system. The Fabrinet IT provided FITSDLL documentation/sample code for FITs data communication, also nLight QA provided Fabrinet SPC charts vs. nLight SPC charts mappings.
